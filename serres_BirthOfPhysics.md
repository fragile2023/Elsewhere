## p4

declination

Paulum, tantum quod momen mutatum dicere possis "a little, just so much that you can call it a change of movement"

## p5

The clinamen is thus a differential, (…) a fluxion

## p6

What is the clinamen?

It is the minimum angle of formation of a vortex, appearing by chance in a laminar flow

nunc hinc, nunc illinc

"suave mari magno, turbantibus aequors ventis"

How sweet is it when on the open see the winds are troubling the waters, "atomorum turbulenta concursio"

## p28

| turba | turbo |
|-------|-------|
| turbulence | vortex |
| disorder | movement\* |

\*particular form of movement

## p29-30

der Kreisel (spinning top) und Bewegung, Stabilität und Widersprüche "if one day some subtle and playful dialectician disconcerts you, be quiet, don't answer, join the children, play at top."

## p32

brachistochrone, *Thalweg* bei Leibniz; existence is the loop of a river that has flowed to better bed

## p33

Clinamen (declination): it is the smallest possible slope opening the path to existence declination defines a slop–slope begins with loss of equilibrium

where the laminar sheet hits the rapids and rolls in spirals. The annular turbulence which remains stable for a moment and then unwinds slowly down the length of the flux flowing on the plane

Leibniz obstacles, Lucretius void; universe and the inclined plane

at the dawn of things, in the past and to come, here and there, indefinitely, at the heart of the universe there exists an inclined plane wherecoils roll by the temporal flux of matter

## p34

The world, objects, bodies, my very soul are, at the moment of their birth, in *decline*

Time: the past, the present, the future, the dawn of appearances and death, tenacious illusions, are only the declination of matter. They decline and are declined like the tense of a verb, a word made up of atom letters

The world, objects, bodies, my very soul are, at the moment of their birth, adrift.

Adrift, down a long the inclined plateau. This means in common terms, that they irreversibly fall apart and die.

Their stability, conjunction, existence are give up to homeorhesis ("similar flow"), steady flow the drift is the whole of time roots & word & meaning – everything drifts, whatever happens from the original atoms, the backdrop. Everything drifts from the elementary roots: and so it is with words, the shifting aggregations of atom-letters. Here is the origin of meaning, the transverse lightening-flash on the backdrop that is the background noise. Sense is nothing but its slope, it the sense of the slope. It is another drift. Existence, time, meaning and language go down the inclined plane together.

## p35

Physics: weight, heat, fluids: falling, irreverisble flow. All this needs a slope. The clinamen produces just this inclined path.

## p36

What is Genesis in general, siehe refs up to Kant

## p37

Carnot cycle

Ataraxy (Epikur)

"I am myself deviation, and my soul declines, my global body is open, adrift, It slips, irreversibly, on the slope. Who am I? A vortex. A dispersal that becomes undone. Yes a singularity, a singular.

## p38

Ataraxy is the material background of the being, a permanent murmur against which the flying words are outlined, birth and death. releasing Sysiphos: I accept dissolution in the burning plasma of matter. "and the rest is turbulence"

## p39

Venus

There is a flux given off by things

The simulacrum *detaches* itself as the optimal form of the volume occupied by an object, as a *sur-face*

## p40

Description of the interior of the body "these tortuous paths, in the complexity of the material fabric, are the paths of the fragile soul"

nice description! Simulacra (von Baudrillard geklaut?)

simul: at the same time simulo: simulation

the thing is a black hole , from them the flux falls; it preserves form

## p41

more rapid (less obstacles)

über scientific modernity and a break with antiquity as artifact produced by the university ("specialized animals") ("We have never been modern") "As if knowledge should have it ground in ignorance"

## p42

model of perception and information theory

"liquidissime caeli tempestas, perquam subito fit turbida foede" "...just when the climate of the skies is clearest, it turns most suddenly dark and foul"

"upon reception, the images form quamvis subito, as quickly as one could wish"

"simulacra fly throuh the air" traverse great distance in a brief instant --> what we see, "Whatever the place might be"

## p49

The soul is a material body, the body is a thing, the subject is just an objct, physiology or psychology is just physics and, consequently, the senses are reliable (…) Venus vs Mars

## p50

Every nascent object is initially a vortex, as indeed is the world. (Archimedes: spirals, angles, cones, differential calculation, axiom, sand and floating bodies. The law of greatest slope

Every object, naturally, emerges like Aphrodite from a flux of elements

## p102

genealogy of simulacra

## p103

since every object could only be produced in and through a vortex, or a spiral, it is turbulence as such, that becomes the transmitter of its enevelopes (simulacra)

Every form is enveloped an infinity of adherences, sliding infinitely from the virtual to the actual. Here are the elements of things, teir requisite in vortices, and the conditions of knowledge

Epicurus vs Plato

the garden (kepos)

## p104

opposing theories of knowledge

idols & ideas

eidolon -> neuter , an inanimate, impersonal, asexual agent

"that which produces form. A singularity of language"

image, phantom (Homer), Plato: the tomb body is a neutral phantom, as opposite to the real thing–the soul; hell is here; a world of dream and death; the image (eidolon) is false, like a still-born child, after an abortion, worse then false, it is foolishness (Homer), Plato: the tomb body is a neutral phantom, as opposite to the real thing–the soul; hell is here; a world of dream and death; the image (eidolon) is false, like a still-born child, after an abortion, worse then false, it is foolishness.

## p105

Plato: eidolon produces images, appearances, brightness in water, in air, in mirrors. "false imaginings in the subject"

"he who sees dreams that he sees, she who is alive is in fact dead, she who desires is filled with anguish, the body is the corpse, the world is hell, truth false and senses phantasmagorical.

Ref. apostle Paulus & Christianity (-> plato)

Epicurus: the return of the body, truth as true, eidos (idea) is error, eidolon (agent) is truth, tranquil appearance in a real world; "everything goes back to the working of the idols" "a science is required to secure peace"

Nature is seen, touched, felt, full of emanations, fragrances, and murmurs, bitterness and salinity; "forms communicate with forms by way of forms" which they auto-produce" Eidolon = neuter, inanimate = atom, group of atoms..., "the id is material", dream, death, senses ->exact, precise, faithful

the neuter 'eidos', this atomic block', invites suffixive links (eidol-on); the mathematics of Epicureans is a science of images: neuter producing infinte multiplicities of form;

either the lucid subject and the luminous object, or, the subject-object compact through and through

Plato – eidolon flees through dreams, phantoms, anxieties, death, lies and double world down the path

Epicurus – flees through physics and mathematics, nature and truth, down that of materiality; happiness / rejoicing

# p106-107

theory of simulacra, theory of perception

"sensation is a generalized sense of touch"

All perceptions are true!

"The world is no longer in the distance, it is nearby, tangible. The theory of simulacra is a singular case of the general theory of flow, communication is one circulation among others, knowledge is no different than being.

Like all philosophers passionately concerned with objective reality, Lucretius was a genius of touch and not vision, which is the model of close ologies that take their distance, through repugnance or repulsion. Knowledge is not seeing, it is entering into contact, directly, with things; and besides, they come to us. The physics of Aphrodite is a science of caresses. Objects, in the distance, change their skins, they send one another kisses. In the distance the square tower, angular,stiff, coarse; it comes to me, round, sleek and smooth. A phenomenology of the caress, voluptuous knowledge.

# p107-134

Cultural Conditions. Violence and Contract, Science and Religion

Kritik wie Lukrez gelesen wird: The scholiast loathes the world. It cuts L. off from the world. Die Kritik vertseht nicht, dass es sich in dem Text um einen Diskurs über Physik handelt.

Lucretius: Venus sive natura. Mavors sive nature.

## p108

Lukrez setzt auf Venus Western science has continually chosen otherwise than L. It has opted for war

The phyiscs of the fall (Mars), of repetition and rigorous sequence is replaced by the creative science of chance and circumstance. Neither straight nor curved: a spiral.

## p109

without declination (…) only chains of order. The new is born of the old. L. breaks the sequence of reasons & causes

"foedera fati" vs "foedera naturae" (bonds of fate vs bonds of nature) –> Fn 5 The natural contract

the angle (clinamen) disrupts the laws of nature –> appearance of the living; "the same" is non-being" extermination

## p110

turbulence (angle) disturbs the chain (reign of the same); it troubles the flow of the identical, just as Venu disturbs Mars (Fn Mary , K. Difference of the philosophy of Nature in Democritus and Epicurus)

## p111

Physics never about solids

turbulence & freedom

incerto tempore, incertisque locis:

nunc hinc, nunc illinc –> elsewhere

## p113

about Contracts

## p114

war as the mother of all things and: After the battle; Epicurus and Lucretius lay down their weapons, drive Mars out of physics

But:

Modern science: Bacon (command Nature by obeying it), Descartes (we are masters & possessors) the contract (foedor naturae) is broken; the battle resumes: the Nature is adversary –> the law of the hunt; check & mate

Method: strategy, no longer contract; a tactics and not a pact, a game to the death and not an act of coitus (the wolf and the lamb)

decisions: contractual pact? or military strategy? which one as conditions of possibilities of science? Nature: enemy or slave? Adversary or partner? Partner in Contract? the decision has consequences

Western Science following the weight of power;

## p115

Science is conditioned but unconditional

Example Serres: writing a book "we can always go from the thing produced to its conditions, but never from the latter to the former" (contemporary philosophy and the retrospective movement)

This is one of the most serious problems that we have had to face. It is difficult to imagine a rigourous and exact knowledge that could have been influenced by Venus, and not by Mars, by the desire for peace, and not destruction by a contract, and not by strategy, by labourers, and not by generals, since western science has only ever followed the weight of power.

A little space, a chair, a table, three notebooks, two pencils, the average salary that makes them possible, and so also the society today, it’s history and its divisions, all form a group of conditions (…) to write a book. But what kind of book, if ever written, is not determined!

From the book to the conditions

But never

From the conditions to the book

Philosophy therefore: retrospective movement. It is powerless as soon as it begins to go forward, from the condition to the thing. And: for this reason its position is unproductive, not a virtue Of a poverty in here and to the theory, but by virtue of the interminability and indeterminability of the theory itself.

# p115-116

These conditions determine, and strongly, what I would call the global cartography of the conditions. In short: global form and local topography.

# p116

It is still the same science, but it’s topography differs according to its initial contract. The global cartography of the conditions: it’s disposition, the respective situation of the parts, the centre-point of its space, the classification of its constituents and the schema of their relation: the global form in the local topography

It’s still the same clay but the mould has changed

L.‘a physics,(…)Is indeed the same as that of Archimedes, but the Aphroditean postulate and the exclusion of Mars transforms it. Here, hydrostatics is related to the theory of vessels, and there it is drawn towards the constitution of living beings.

Fluid mechanics underpins both, and inert technology and a biology

Forschungspolitik: Now what guides the practice of science is, more often than one might notice, the organisation of its parts

On classification

The formative element of a generation is less the contents of what it knows then the apprenticeship that leads to this knowledge.

Pedagogy “Duce” methodology=path

The battle: And if knowledge works for death and destruction, it is because Mars or the military, the commander in Bacon, or the Cartesian master and possessor, are there keeping watch over the beginnings.

# p116-117

Strategy is not only a dynamics and an energetics, it is first and foremost a topology

The condition of Mars or the condition of Venus: this is what determines the world map of knowledge. No one has ever ordered signs except by flowcharts. And, thereafter, the master ignores the content. But that is no longer of any importance.

Foedus Is the pact of postwar period, the peace treaty, armistice is signed

The plague is figure of violence in general

fable , Girard, victim,

Two figures of violence: deluge and plague

Contract of blood: foedor fati

# p118

The problem lies in stemming a series of murders otherwise then by another murder.

E. (…) Takes on the dangerous position assigned to him by his knowledge of the laws of the universe and of human mechanisms.

In the face of these horrible threats, he goes forth, unarmed.

To take on alone, the fire of the heavens, not to displace it by unleashing violence on the nearest bystander, the virgin Iphigenia, but to advance unarmed before it, deciphering, lucidly, what is happening; this is precisely conduct contrary to all religion, to the terrifying constitution of the sacred.

# p120-121

The criterion of truth is the risk of error. The only path to discovery is the absolute willingness to make mistakes in front of the others.

All the rest is only power.

The increasing labour of humanity seeks to hold the irrevocability of atomic erosion

History advances across the surface, while it retreats at depth. It heads upstream against a current that descent more quickly then it can advance. The excess is discrepant, the plague will return.

The Soul of the wise human extends to the global universe. The wise human is the universe. In repose, he or she is herself the pact.

Man is not a stranger, but a friend.

Aphroditean Contract with things

Many other wisdoms and many other sciences are founded, conversely, on the violation of the contract. Man is a stranger to the world, to the dawn, to the sky, to things. He hates them and struggles against them.

Martial neuroses, from Plato to Descartes, from Bacon to our time. Hatred of objects at the root of knowledge, the horror of the world at the foundation of theory.

**The appearance of a think external to mere relations**

relationships in stereotypical fashion between humans and gods animals and animals

"hominisation" (beyond species?) consists in this message: 'here is some bread';whoever I am, whoever yu are. Hoc est, this is, in the neuter. Neuter for gender; paradoxically there are no men, there are no human groups, until after the appearance of the object as such

'I, you, she, we etc.'vs 'this, here, ecce'  

The political animal, he who subordinates every object to the relation between subjects, is just a mammal among others, a wolf, for example, a wolf among other wolves. 

In pure politics, Hobbes’ remark that man is a wolf for man is not a metaphor, it is an exact indication of the regression to the state preceding the emergence of the object.  

The origin of the theatre, comedy, tragedy is as old as the origin of political relations: it is thrust into animality. Politics and theatre are just mammals.  

# p133 

The discovery of the object offers an opening and a chance to escape the network of our relations 

The object a neutral terrain!  

Lessons of Epicureanism 

They come down to this: reduce to a minimum the network of relations in which you are plunged. Live in the garden, a small space, with a few friends. No family, if possible, and in any event no politics. Aphrodite, pleasure, is born of the world in the waters. Mars is in the forum and in the armed crowd. Bring your relations to little and your object to the world, the intersubjective to the minimum, and the objective to the maximum. Your back turned on politics, study physics. Peace in the neuter. Such knowledge brings happiness, at least an end to our worst pains. Forget the sacred. This means: forget the violence that founds it, and forget the religious, which links men to one another. Consider the object, objects, nature. Yes he or she who said this, ecce, hoc est, this one, Memmius, is a god, god among men. He or she changed hominid nature.
