*particular form of movement


## p29-30

der Kreisel (spinning top) und Bewegung, Stabilität und Widersprüche "if one day some subtle and playful dialectician disconcerts you, be quiet, don't answer, join the children, play at top."

## p32

brachistochrone, *Thalweg* bei Leibniz;
existence is the loop of a river that has flowed to better bed

## p33

Clinamen (declination): it is the smallest possible slope opening the path to existence 
declination defines a slop–slope begins with loss of equilibrium

where the laminar sheet hits the rapids and rolls in spirals. The annular turbulence which remains stable for a moment and then unwinds slowly down the length of the flux flowing on the plane

Leibniz obstacles, Lucretius void; universe and the inclined plane

at the dawn of things, in the past and to come, here and there, indefinitely, at the heart of the universe there exists an inclined plane wherecoils roll by the temporal flux of matter

## p34

The world, objects, bodies, my very soul are, at the moment of their birth, in *decline*

Time: the past, the present, the future, the dawn of appearances and death, tenacious illusions, are only the declination of matter. They decline and are declined like the tense of a verb, a word made up of atom letters

The world, objects, bodies, my very soul are, at the moment of their birth, adrift.

Adrift, down a long the inclined plateau. This means in common terms, that they irreversibly fall apart and die. 

Their stability, conjunction, existence are give up to homeorhesis ("similar flow"), steady flow
the drift is the whole of time
roots & word & meaning – everything drifts, whatever happens from the original atoms, the backdrop. Everything drifts from the elementary roots: and so it is with words, the shifting aggregations of atom-letters. Here is the origin of meaning, the transverse lightening-flash on the backdrop that is the background noise. Sense is nothing but its slope, it the sense of the slope. It is another drift. Existence, time, meaning and language go down the inclined plane together.

## p35

Physics: weight, heat, fluids: falling, irreverisble flow. All this needs a slope. The clinamen produces just this inclined path.

## p36

What is Genesis in general,  siehe refs up to Kant

## p37

Carnot cycle

Ataraxy (Epikur)

"I am myself deviation, and my soul declines, my global body is open, adrift, It slips, irreversibly, on the slope. Who am I? A vortex. A dispersal that becomes undone. Yes a singularity, a singular.

## p38

Ataraxy is the material background of the being, a permanent murmur against which the flying words are outlined, birth and death.
releasing Sysiphos: I accept dissolution in the burning plasma of matter.
"and the rest is turbulence"

## p39

Venus

There is a flux given off by things

The simulacrum *detaches* itself as the optimal form of the volume occupied by an object, as a *sur-face*

## p40

Description of the interior of the body "these tortuous paths, in the complexity of the material fabric, are the paths of the fragile soul"

nice description! Simulacra (von Baudrillard geklaut?)

simul: at the same time
simulo: simulation

the thing is a black hole , from them the flux falls; it preserves form

## p41

more rapid (less obstacles)

über scientific modernity and a break with antiquity as artifact produced by the university ("specialized animals")
("We have never been modern")
"As if knowledge should have it ground in ignorance"

## p42

model of perception and information theory

"liquidissime caeli tempestas, perquam subito fit turbida foede"
"...just when the climate of the skies is clearest, it turns most suddenly dark and foul"

"upon reception, the images form quamvis subito, as quickly as one could wish"

"simulacra fly throuh the air" traverse great distance in a brief instant --> what we see, "Whatever the place might be"

## p49

The soul is a material body, the body is a thing, the subject is just an objct, physiology or psychology is just physics and, consequently, the senses are reliable (…)
Venus vs Mars

## p50
 Every nascent object is initially a vortex, as indeed is the world. (Archimedes: spirals, angles, cones, differential calculation, axiom, sand and floating bodies. The law of greatest slope
 
Every object, naturally, emerges like Aphrodite from a flux of elements
