# Notes


>The criterion of truth is risk of error. The only path to discovery is the absolute willingness to make mistakes in front of the others.

## Elsewhere and research domains, fields of interest

### Science & Society

beyond science propaganda, no "citizen science" (useful idiots), or naive application of scientific findings, or ending political debate in the name of science, research in the wild, 
Science and Society relation: fear, anxiety, obedience, ignorance

### Science & (surveillance) Capitalism

conflict of interests, academia, industry, government ("triple helix")


### Science & War

Science is conditioned but unconditional (Serres, M. Birth of physics, what conditions for doing science? STS, etc)

### Science & religion (institution)

Academia, the path of discovery, Science as Police, "pass on, there is nothing to see!"
The role of education, pedagogy, the intellectual of the third dimension
academy vs the garden (Kepos)

(fable: the garden and the cliff, GS Brown in A Lion's Teeth)


## Elsewhere and research: we must return to the things itself

Question: does the appearance of "objects" or things" change our understanding of what is meant to be human?

Before the appearance of objects or things: merely interrelated subjects, that act in stereotypical fashion: repeated cycles of violence, war, sacrifice, peace
Appearance of objects external to relations of subjects; creating the bonds with things/objects, it is not about the "I, Thou, We etc" but about "This, here, ecce!
appearance of quasi-objects; the becoming quasi-objects), The art of the contract (foedor naturae)

elsewhere metaphor e.g. the clinamen, the turbulence, the vortex in a laminar flow
**nunc hinc, nunc illinc** now here, then there,  
incerto tempore, incertisque locis: at an indefinte time and place)

Network of (pop up) "gardens" (here & there,  like the clinamen, the turbulence), ataraxia, aponia) sustainability, inclusiveness, aesthetics, emancipated learner, (connotation of garden â€“> caring for / 

Elsewhere appears where the local generates an interesting pact/contract a turbulence;

### Garden in Serres' Birth of Phyiscs

They come down to this: reduce to a minimum the network of relations in which you are plunged. Live in the garden, a small space, with a few friends. No family, if possible, and in any event no politics. Aphrodite, pleasure, is born of the world in the waters. Mars is in the forum and in the armed crowd. Bring your relations to little and your object to the world, the intersubjective to the minimum, and the objective to the maximum. Your back turned on politics, study physics. Peace in the neuter. Such knowledge brings happiness, at least an end to our worst pains. Forget the sacred. This means: forget the violence that founds it, and forget the religious, which links men to one another. Consider the object, objects, nature. Yes he or she who said this, ecce, hoc est, this one, Memmius, is a god, god among men. He or she changed hominid nature.

go to elsewhere, make a chair, sit down and think. grow roots, go to another place, leave chair behind, make a new chair...

there is always something more important (problem of loyality regarding disicplines); against lazy thinking;

## Narratives and the problem of underdetermination of the theory by the facts

Th. Snyder, last episodes on The History of Ukraine, 

he talks about on the "high tech" internet and social media and how "low-tech behaviourist brain-hacks" ("we have to change the algorithms") produce the problem of narratives, by "ignoring the facts"; a problem that comes with decline of investigative journalism; "we need to take care of producing more facts that enrich narratives *to stabilize them, to make them good narratives* (Atlan, Underdetermination of the theories(models) by the facts (observations)), "facts are surprising, puzzling", if narratives go unchallenged and rush forwards without the production of facts, narratives or fights of narratives not self-correcting; teaching democracy as struggle;

Serres, M. Comment on dialectics when talking about spinning top: "if one day some subtle and playful dialectician disconcerts you, be quiet, don't answer, join the children, play at top."
