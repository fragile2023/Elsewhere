## Elsewhere and research domains, fields of interest

### Science & Society

beyond science propaganda, no "citizen science" (useful idiots), or naive application of scientific findings, or ending political debate in the name of science, research in the wild, s
Science and Society relation: fear, anxiety, obedience, 'moralistic scientism', ignorance, 

#### "shruggers"

Elsewhere a place for "shruggers"? A place not so much designed for generalists, but for those shrugging their shoulders at the claims of generalizing theoreticians that define them as subordinates charged with the task of "applying" theory or that capture their practice as an illustration of their theory

#### laughing

Elsewhere a place for those who  have already effected the "political shift" associated with political ecology* and thus learned to laugh not at theories but at the authority associated with them?
*political ecology: the politicization of 'positive' knowledge-related issues or practices concerning "things";

#### idiots

Elsewhere a place for idiots? again the conceptual character of the "idiot" that stands for "slowing down" (resisting the consensual way or emergency thinking "there is no alternative", hesitating to say what is good (because there something more important)

(Stengers in her Cosmopolitical Proposal)

#### Avoid imperialistic thinking

Elsewhere a place to learn to avoid imperialistic thinking; some symptoms of imperialistic thinking:

- The wolf in the Fable: The Wolf and the Lamb by LaFontaine; always right, everywhere right, under all circumstances right: WolfDescartes
- "our" knowledge, "our" technical equipment that produces facts; "our" judgements of "our" practices
- "good will" and "respect for others"
- designate something to encompass those that refuse to be encompassed by something else
- condem as fanatic blindness, or selfishness of those who refuse to acknowledge that they cannot escape eg "planetary issues"
- tolerance, the call for tolerance
- the temptation to call for peace with the power to ask anything that diverges to recognize itself as purely individual expression of what constitutes the point of convergence of all
- dwelling on the privilege that allows to refuse or to neglect the learning of languages
- 'mise en equivalence' (as opposed to 'mise en egalité'); equalization of positions under on yardstick, a common measure, and thus creating interchangeability of positions
- explaining away ("…and so…" quick in explaining what follows from an event), rhetoric of "but": "but it is only" "but there is something else" …
- feelings of mastering the situation in the political arena
- denying that the political arena (maybe) is populated with shadows of that which does not have a political voice, cannot have or does not want to have one
- being in the position to demand "express yourself, express your objections, your proposals, your contribution to the common world that "we're" building



#### No Moralistic Scientism

In the progressive imagination, science is sometimes treated  like a static text that's easy to interpret, with clear takeaways for behaviour. One of the big mistakes (…) is the mantra 'Follow the science', as though science is not contested, as though there are not evidentiary gaps, as though there are not conflicting reports and data points you have to navigate your way through."
-> "moralistic scientism" 
-> science infallibly validates lefty moral sensibilities
(NYer 29.12.2022 article on "Peoples CDC")



### Science & (surveillance) Capitalism

conflict of interests, academia, industry, government ("triple helix")


[###](###) Science & War

war as the mother of all things and: After the battle; Epicurus and Lucretius lay down their weapons, drive Mars out of physics

But:

Modern science: Bacon (command Nature by obeying it), Descartes (we are masters & possessors) the contract (foedor naturae) is broken; the battle resumes: the Nature is adversary –> the law of the hunt; check & mate

Method: strategy, no longer contract; a tactics and not a pact, a game to the death and not an act of coitus (the wolf and the lamb)

decisions: contractual pact? or military strategy? which one as conditions of possibilities of science? Nature: enemy or slave? Adversary or partner? Partner in Contract? the decision has consequences

Western Science following the weight of power;


Science is conditioned but unconditional (Serres, M. Birth of physics, what conditions for doing science? STS, etc)

### Science & religion (institution)

Academia, the path of discovery, Science as Police, "pass on, there is nothing to see!"
The role of education, pedagogy, the intellectual of the third dimension
academy vs the garden (Kepos)

(fable: the garden and the cliff, GS Brown in A Lion's Teeth)


## Elsewhere and research: we must return to the things itself

### War, Peace and Violence

Why turning away from (human) subjects towards "objects", "things"?

#### Violence, War and Peace in Serres, M. the Natural Contract, Girard

#### Lessons in Imperial Experience, Violence, Hate, Revenge

non imperialistic thinking



![In the field](https://uboot.duckdns.org/index.php/s/3xYpc3QtNaziyLd/download)

Question: does the appearance of "objects" or things" change our understanding of what is meant to be human?

Before the appearance of objects or things: merely interrelated subjects, that act in stereotypical fashion: repeated cycles of violence, war, sacrifice, peace
Appearance of objects external to relations of subjects; creating the bonds with things/objects, it is not about the "I, Thou, We etc" but about "This, here, ecce!
appearance of quasi-objects; the becoming of quasi-objects), The art of the contract (foedor naturae)

### Garden in Serres' Birth of Phyiscs

#### Lessons of Epicureanism 

They come down to this: reduce to a minimum the network of relations in which you are plunged. Live in the garden, a small space, with a few friends. No family, if possible, and in any event no politics. Aphrodite, pleasure, is born of the world in the waters. Mars is in the forum and in the armed crowd. Bring your relations to little and your object to the world, the intersubjective to the minimum, and the objective to the maximum. Your back turned on politics, study physics. Peace in the neuter. Such knowledge brings happiness, at least an end to our worst pains. Forget the sacred. This means: forget the violence that founds it, and forget the religious, which links men to one another. Consider the object, objects, nature. Yes he or she who said this, ecce, hoc est, this one, Memmius, is a god, god among men. He or she changed hominid nature.

Leben im Verborgenen


#### Lessions in A-Priori A-Posteriori Research

Its is about entering into relationships with "objects"; not because we want to save the world, decrease the amount of CO2, cure a diseaese etc, (all of this can be a collateral effect haha), it is about 'response-ability', non-strategically, non-instrumental, commited to non-imperialistic thinking


**Methodologies a priori _and_ a posteriori**

see despretNaissanceTheorieEthologique1996

p140

*a priori*: invariants of behavior are the "a priori" of the program and innate mechanisms are triggering these programs. (Lorenz heir of Kant)

"a priori methodologies" (hypothesis testing in the field), the researcher loaded with an a priori methodology enters the field (terrain) equipped with an hypothesis, to which the facts will be submitted; 

His ace is, in case it occurs, the regularity of reality; procedure and interest meet in a system of resonance, in a mirroring  system.

Researchers are much more prepared to enter an experimental route. (manipilation of variables as adequate method to measure and understand any invariants.

The method of deception as adequate means.

p141

The substitution of the bird's egg. The a priori researcher eliminates ordinary conditions of observation. The program and the Method: methodologies and object enter into a resonance, creating an isomorphism, producing a mirror effect.

*a posteriori*: "ce qui se sait après l'expérience" -> it is not about the experience of the experimenter, but the common experience; before entering the field no explicit hypothesis is formulated; (approach resembles anthropological approach)

p142

The a posteriori researcher attaches herself to anecdotal facts and to  difference/diversity/variability on which she grounds her shared experience;
there is a *continuum* between a priori and a posteriori research and this continuum can be observed in the person of K. Lorenz;
In the field Lorenz applies an apriori approach (searching for invariants) and an a posteriori (anthropological) approach;

p143

L.' theory bears signs of a hybdridization of methods;

* the experimental (a priori) approach: proofs the a priori of program (imprinting of following);
* the anthropological (a posteriori) approach: reveals the variety/variability that has not been foreseen by the program; it allows to create a space for surprise and creativity;

**Investigation and Trial**

p144

* A priorists (trial): testing the reality, proofing the reliability of witnesses
+ A porteriorists (investigation): collecting signs which contradict the innocence of behaviors, looking for a hidden meaning in seemingly non-related facts; (Sherlock Holmes/ Zahavi does not believe in the innocence of birds)

p145

* experimental process/trial confronts any fictional reality
* investigation is a fictional, hypothetical construction, which only can convince by the power of its proposal, the mode of trial/process challenges these fictions and puts them to (by an experimental dispositive) to test

**The experiment as the place of the trial**

p147-149

experiments on the memory capacities of tits (Mesange/Meisen): an **imaginary tribunal** as a guarantee against subjectivity, counteracting a single opinion;

The experiment becomes an imaginary public space 

**The Arabian Babblers during the trial**

p151

testing hypthesis regarding brood care and nourishing offspring

## Narratives and the problem of underdetermination of the theory by the facts

Th. Snyder, last episodes on The History of Ukraine, 

he talks about on the "high tech" internet and social media and how "low-tech behaviourist brain-hacks" ("we have to change the algorithms") produce the problem of narratives, by "ignoring the facts"; a problem that comes with decline of investigative journalism; "we need to take care of producing more facts that enrich narratives *to stabilize them, to make them good narratives* (Atlan, Underdetermination of the theories(models) by the facts (observations)), "facts are surprising, puzzling", if narratives go unchallenged and rush forwards without the production of facts, narratives or fights of narratives not self-correcting; teaching democracy as struggle;

Serres, M. Comment on dialectics when talking about spinning top: "if one day some subtle and playful dialectician disconcerts you, be quiet, don't answer, join the children, play at top."
