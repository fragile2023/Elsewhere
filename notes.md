# Notes

## We must return to the things itself

The criterion of truth is risk of error. The only path to discovery is the absolute willingness to make mistakes in front of the others

## 2005 – Making Things Public

## Narratives and the problem of underdetermination of the theory by the facts

Th. Snyder, last episodes on The History of Ukraine, 

he talks about on the "high tech" internet and social media and how "low-tech behaviourist brain-hacks" ("we have to change the algorithms") produce the problem of narratives, by "ignoring the facts"; a problem that comes with decline of investigative journalism; "we need to take care of producing more facts that enrich narratives *to stabilize them, to make them good narratives* (Atlan, Underdetermination of the theories(models) by the facts (observations)), "facts are surprising, puzzling", if narratives go unchallenged and rush forwards without the production of facts, narratives or fights of narratives not self-correcting; teaching democracy as struggle;

Serres, M. Comment on dialectics when talking about spinning top: "if one day some subtle and playful dialectician disconcerts you, be quiet, don't answer, join the children, play at top."

## Elsewhere and research domains, fields of interest

### Science & Society

beyond science propaganda, no "citizen science" (useful idiots), or naive application of scientific findings, or ending political debate in the name of science, research in the wild, 
Science and Society relation: fear, anxiety, obedience, ignorance

### Science & (surveillance) Capitalism

conflict of interests, academia, industry, government ("triple helix")


### Science & War

Science is conditioned but unconditional (Serres, M. Birth of physics, what conditions for doing science? STS, etc)

### Science & religion (institution)

Academia, the path of discovery, Science as Police, "pass on there is nothing to see!", 
The role of education, pedagogy, the intellectual of the third dimension
academy vs the garden (Kepos)

(fable: the garden and the cliff, GS Brown in A Lion's Teeth)


## Elsewhere and research

elsewhere metaphor e.g. the clinamen, the turbulence, the vortex in a laminar flow
**nunc hinc, nunc illinc** here and there,  
incerto tempore, incertisque locis: at an indefinte time and place)

Network of (pop up) "gardens" (here & there like the clinamen, the turbulence), ataraxia, aponia) sustainability, inclusiveness, aesthetics, emancipated learner, (connotation of garden –> caring for / creating the bonds with things/objects/subjects, appearance of quasi-objects; not about the "I, Thou, We etc" but about "This, here, ecce! and the becoming quasi-objects), The art of the contract (foedor naturae)

Elsewhere appears where the local generates an interesting pact/contract a turbulence;

Working in the garden, Incubation(s) Description & Intervention, "Horizontality" and anarchist? strategies

go to elsewhere, make a chair, sit down and think. grow roots, go to another place, leave chair behind, make a new chair...

there is always something more important (problem of loyality regarding disicplines); against lazy thinking;
