# Notes

## We must return to the things itself

The criterion of truth is risk of error. The only path to discovery is the absolute willingness to make mistakes in front of the others

## 2005 â€“ Making Things Public

## Narratives and the problem of underdetermination of the theory by the facts

Th. Snyder, last episodes on The History of Ukraine, 

he talks about on the "high tech" internet and social media and how "low-tech behaviourist brain-hacks" ("we have to change the algorithms") produce the problem of narratives, by "ignoring the facts"; a problem that comes with decline of investigative journalism; "we need to take care of producing more facts that enrich narratives *to stabilize them, to make them good narratives*(Atlan, Underdetermination of the theories(models) by the facts (observations)), "facts are surprising, puzzling", if narratives go unchallenged and rush forwards without the production of facts, narratives or fights of narratives not self-correcting; teaching democracy as struggle;

Serres, M. Comment of dialectics when talking about spinning top: "if one day some subtle and playful dialectician disconcerts you, be quiet, don't answer, join the children, play at top.

## European Bauhaus and "Inclusiveness"

Topology of the Possible. What is a Body-a Person?

(see also Serres, M on the "hominisation of humas" through "things" external to their internal relationships)

After the battle

## Elsewhere and research domains, fields of interest

### Science & Society

beyond science propaganda, no "citizen science" (useful idiots), or naive application of scientific findings, or ending political debate in the name of science, research in the wild, 
Science and Society relation: fear, anxiety, obedience, ignorance

### Science & (surveillance) Capitalism

conflict of interests, academia, industry, government ("triple helix")


### Science & (surveillance) War

Science is conditioned but unconditional (Serres, M. Birth of physics, what conditions for doing science? STS, etc)

### Science as religion (institution)

Academia, the path of discovery, Science as Police, pass on there is nothing to see


there is always something more important; against lazy thinking;

bring your chair, sit down and think. Take chair and place it somewhere else.
